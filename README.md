# NG Memtac
A simple game of nots and crosses but with a little twist.
Exactly like tic tac toe but the selected squares are invisible. So a player cannot tell which piece they or another has selected.
However, the latest selected piece is known, and this behaviour is configurable.

A player can query is a piece is occupied.
